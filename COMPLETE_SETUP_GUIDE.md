## 🚀 How It Works

### Weekly Report Flow
1. **Sunday 8 PM** - Cron triggers
2. Scraper fetches 14-day schedule from API
3. Filters for Amherst Stadium
4. Generates HTML email + CSV
5. Sends to tom@curlys.ca

### Change Monitoring Flow
1. **12:30 PM / 4:30 PM / 1:00 AM** - Cron triggers
2. Scraper fetches current 7-day schedule
3. Compares with previous snapshot
4. If changes found:
   - Identifies what changed (added/removed/modified)
   - Sends alert email with details
   - Updates snapshot
5. If no changes:
   - Updates snapshot silently
   - No email sent

## 🔄 Recent Fixes (Nov 2, 2025)

**Issue 1: Games showing "TBA" for teams**
- **Cause:** API returns two data formats (games vs practices)
- **Fix:** Updated scraper to handle both formats
- **Result:** Games now show "Team A vs Team B"

**Issue 2: Missing games from schedule**
- **Cause:** Date filtering only checked practice dates, not game dates
- **Fix:** Check both `team_schedule_date` and `game_date` fields
- **Result:** All 9 games now included (was finding 0)

**Issue 3: Duplicate entries**
- **Cause:** API returns overlapping entries for same time slot
- **Fix:** Deduplicate by preferring game entries over practice entries
- **Result:** Clean schedule without duplicates
